# Log-Portfolio-Data
This repository's purpose is to automatically track the value of a dividend portfolio on every weekday of the year and create graphs to illustrate the portfolio's value,
dividend income, and dividend yield.

For a full walkthrough on how to set the script up, check out my YouTube video where I guide you through the process: 

Here are the general steps:

1. Open The Spreadsheet at this link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TnMjjuu5LknSn-wKpJ2-mKmrO7RD5kX3Y3jt7NMBWlw/edit?usp=sharing
2. On the bottom right click on "Value_Over_Time" and choose "Copy to".  You can copy this sheet to a new spreadsheet or an existing one.
3. Go to the new sheet you just created.
4. In each of the cells to the right of the cells labeled "Portfolio Value", "Dividend Income", and "Dividend Yield", create references to cells in your spreadsheet that contain those corresponding values.
